# Thank you Snapask

### After four and a half years, I'm leaving Snapask, a company that I helped start. It's grown into something beyond our wildest dreams, so I wrote a thank you letter to the people who helped make it happen.

The best thing about starting a company is the people you get to meet and work with. My adventure wouldn't have been possible without the support of our colleagues and friends. As my journey comes to an end, I'd like to appreciate to those who travelled it with me.

Thank you. Bon voyage!
