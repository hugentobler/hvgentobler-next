# Thirty Taiwan vanlife days

### Surfvan - check. Surfboard - check. Surfmap - check. Finally found the time to do the Taiwan round-the-island roadtrip. Circled the island 3 times, covering nearly all highways, ate more than planned, and surfed less than expected. Enjoy the video and snapshots.

First, let's talk about the van. I spent a month trying to rent a Westy. The plan was to live in the van for a month. I had to find a vehicle that could fit me, a 9 foot surfboard, and all my belongings.

There's an emerging vanlife community in Taiwan - google "Westylife Taiwan" or visit Swell Co. Café in 大安. However, no sane owner of a lovingly converted campervan or restored Vanagon, no matter how chill, is going to rent it to a stranger.

Luckily with some trial and error, through a guy, and another guy, I rented an unconverted 1999 VWT4 for a price I could stomach. The market for long-term rentals doesn't exist, so be ready to pay more than expected.

With a van finally, I packed up and left Taipei.

The van went up mountain passes and over sand dunes. Anywhere reached by roads was accessible.

A lot of vanlife time is spent finding running water for showers. Thankfully there's no shortage of freecamping guides and maps, even in places faraway from surf communities.

I spent less time surfing than expected. Relentless northeasterly winds snapped my first board. An onlooking surfer sighed and said, "This is heaven's way of telling you to stay out of the water today."

Later when passing through 台東, I picked up a beautiful green surfboard. It's a performance longboard, who's first owner was called Yoichi. What a fun board - I named it Yoshi.

Taiwan's spine is a formidable mountain range running from north to south. Driving over it proved too much for the van. No permanent damage done, but a multiday hike I had planned was cancelled.

What an incredible experience. To think it was possible during COVID - thank you Taiwan!

And I haven't even talked about the food. It was all sublime.
